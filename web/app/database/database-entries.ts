    title: "Assessing Offshore Wind Potential",
    author: "Adelaja, Adesoji, et al.",
    link: "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.072",
    description: "This source was published in 2012 and is an academic journal written by Aesoji Adelaja. In the journal the author builds a theoretical framework for a potential offshore wind model. It discusses the impacts of social limitations as well as technological limitations and impacts. It goes into detail regarding possible costs whether they are social or financial. There is a large absence of data regarding Michigan’s offshore wind potential. Therefore this data needs to be discovered. A major limitation the source talks about is the minimum distance from the shore the turbines must be. This distance brings higher costs. The author estimates that cost can range from $9500 to $20,000 per kilometer from shore each turbine is. A major sticking point for people in Michigan is that they don’t want to see the wind turbines from shore as they see it as wrecking the view. Therefore this source provides a deep dive into the cost and impacts of wind turbines in the Great Lakes as well as the social cost and impacts.",

    description: 'In this article the author Mark Berman talks about the development of the Icebreaker Wind Farm in the Great Lakes. He starts by stating that the Great Lakes have the potential to produce 700 gigawatts of wind energy. He then goes on to talk about how the Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation is planning to build a 20 megawatt demonstration wind farm in Lake Erie called Icebreaker. It will consist only of 6 turbines initially and is planned to start in 2025. This project could help prove the effectiveness of offshore wind to the public and as well to legislation. However, he states that the people living in the area are very concerned about possible pollution into Lake Erie during the construction process and from the turbines in the future as well. Another concern is how the turbines will affect the migratory routes of many bird species. There is a large petition consisting of 9000 signatures at the time of the article opposing the project. Berman makes a point regarding the influx of jobs the construction will create as well as a potential boom in the charter fishing industry as the bases will act as mini reefs providing fish with shelter. The project is planning on continuing on schedule. The environmental impacts will be of the highest concern according to the developers. This helps to ease the public\'s mind regarding construction.',

    description: 'This journal is a document by Gerald Carr providing legal insights into Great Lakes offshore wind and Native American tribes in the region. Carr’s focus in the report is to discuss the legal framework for a project like offshore wind farms in the Great Lakes and the possible opposition. He states however, that Native American tribes could possibly invoke stakeholder status and gain equity in some of these projects. He claims that the treaty rights of the tribes will be affected and also that Great Lakes wind energy could be considered a natural resource reserved for them in a treaty. Across the country, Native Americans are having wind turbines built on their lands providing them with much needed power. The same principle can be applied to tribes in the Great Lakes region, specifically in Michigan. The tribes could challenge any development of wind farms under the protection of resources laid out for them in a treaty. This report provides good insights into the rights of Native American tribes and how the development of offshore wind in the Great Lakes are correlated.',

They state that the biggest blocker to offshore wind in the Great Lakes is the legislation in the Great Lakes states. The authors state that the current legislations are not in support of the project even though it is technically feasible. There needs to be a large change in policy in order to allow for this project to go through. The report goes on to state that the offshore wind project could produce up to 6 GW of energy within an economically feasible manner. It points out that large renewable energy projects such as this are hard to compare cost with traditional fossil fuel based projects. However looking at European countries the authors found that they went for a slow build up of offshore wind resulting in a slow cost requirement. The cultural obstacles are another large part of the study. They say that most people have the “not in my back yard” mentality and that people do not want wind turbines obstructing the views of the Great Lakes. Native American tribes also are largely against the idea of offshore wind.
